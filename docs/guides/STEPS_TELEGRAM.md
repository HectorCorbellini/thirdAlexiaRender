# Telegram Scalable Integration Steps (ALEXIA)

## Phase 1: Core Telegram Integration
- [x] Implement TelegramProvider using provider pattern
- [x] Support text/media messages, polling/webhook
- [x] Store Telegram user data in central DB (Postgres)
- [x] Authenticate incoming Telegram messages

## Phase 2: Dashboard-Based Bot Management (Business-Centric)
- [x] Add "Messaging Integrations" section to dashboard (React/TypeScript)
- [x] List all Telegram bots for the logged-in business
- [x] Allow admins to add, configure, enable/disable, and monitor any bot
- [x] Show bot status, last activity, and error logs
- [x] Secure all actions with JWT/role-based access (structure in place, using mock data)

## Phase 3: Backend Multi-Bot Orchestration
- [x] Create `Bots` table: id, businessId, platform, botToken, status, lastActive, config, etc.
- [x] Migrate all Telegram config from .env to DB
- [x] Implement REST API for bot CRUD and lifecycle control
- [x] Backend loads/configures bots from DB at startup
- [x] Each bot runs as a managed process/worker (BotManager service)
- [x] Add endpoints for logs, metrics, and control (start/stop/restart)

## Phase 4: Advanced Features & Scaling
- [ ] Bulk actions (restart all, aggregate stats)
- [ ] Extensible platform support (WhatsApp, Discord, etc.)
- [ ] Smart routing and analytics for all bots
- [ ] SaaS/multi-tenant readiness
